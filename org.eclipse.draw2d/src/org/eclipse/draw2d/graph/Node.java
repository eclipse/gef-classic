/**
 * A node in a DirectedGraph. A node has 0 or more incoming and outgoing {@link Edge}s. A
 * node is given a width and height by the client. When a layout places the node in the
 * graph, it will determine the node's x and y location.  It may also modify the node's
 * height.
 * 
 * A node represents both the <EM>input</EM> and the <EM>output</EM> for a layout
 * algorithm. The following fields are used as input to a graph layout:
 * <UL>
 *   <LI>{@link #width} - the node's width.
 *   <LI>{@link #height} - the node's height.
 *   <LI>{@link #outgoing} - the node's outgoing edges.
 *   <LI>{@link #incoming} - the node's incoming edges.
 *   <LI>padding - the amount of space to be left around the outside of the node.
 *   <LI>{@link #incomingOffset} - the default attachment point for incoming edges.
 *   <LI>{@link #outgoingOffset} - the default attachment point for outgoing edges.
 *   <LI>parent - the parent subgraph containing this node.
 * </UL>
 * <P>
 * The following fields are calculated by a graph layout and comprise the <EM>output</EM>:
 * <UL>
 *   <LI>{@link #x} - the node's x location
 *   <LI>{@link #y} - the node's y location
 *   <LI>{@link #height} - the node's height may be stretched to match the height of other
 *   nodes
 * </UL>
