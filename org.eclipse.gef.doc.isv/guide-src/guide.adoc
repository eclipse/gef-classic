=== [#Overview]#Overview#

Draw2d focuses on efficient painting and layout of figures. The GEF
plug-in adds editing on top of Draw2d. The purpose of this framework is
to:

. Facilitate the display of any model graphically using draw2d figures
. Support interactions from mouse, keyboard, or the Workbench
. Provide common components related to the above

The diagram below shows a high-level view of GEF.  GEF can be loosely
defined as the region in the middle. The framework provides the link
between an application's model and view. It also provides input
handlers, such as tools and actions, that turn events into requests.
Requests and Commands are used to encapsulate interactions and their
effects on the model.

In MVC (model-view-controller) design, the controller is often the only
connection between the view and the model. The controller is responsible
for maintaining the view, and for interpreting UI events and turning
them into operations on the model. These roles as they apply to GEF are
described below:

*Model*

____
The model is any data that gets persisted. Any model can be used with
GEF. The model must have some sort of notification mechanism. Although
not technically the model, commands are closely related. A command is
how the model is modified in a way that can be undone and redone by the
user. In general, commands should work only on the model itself.
____

*View (Figures/TreeItems)*

____
The view is anything visible to the user. Both Figures and TreeItems can
be used as view elements.
____

*Controller (EditPart)*

____
There is usually one controller per visualized model object. The
controller is called an `EditPart`. Editparts are the link between the
model and the view. They are also responsible for editing. Editparts
contain helpers called _EditPolicies_, which handle the much of the
editing task.
____

*Viewers*

____
An `EditPartViewer` is where editparts display their view. There are two
types of viewers provided in GEF. A graphical viewer hosts figures while
a tree viewer displays native treeitems. GEF viewers are similar to
JFace viewers in that they manage an SWT Control. Viewers are also a
selection provider, and the unit of selection is the EditPart.
____

=== [#When]#When can I use GEF?#

GEF can be used anywhere that you can use an SWT Control inside a
Workbench. It could be an editor, a view, a wizard page, etc. Most
commonly it is used inside an EditorPart and sometimes in that editor's
outline page.

GEF requires the Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP) and the "views"
plug-in (`org.eclipse.ui.views`), which provides property sheet support.

=== [#EditParts]#An Introduction to EditParts#

Editparts associate their view and model, but they also form their own
structure. An editpart maintains children. Usually this corresponds to a
similar containment found in the model. For example, the model may
consist of a diagram containing nodes. There would then be a
corresponding diagram editpart which contains multiple node editpart
children.

The parent-child relationship of editparts carries over into their
figures. The parent's figure will contain the children's figures. Or, in
some cases the parent part's view is a compound view composed of several
figures, one of which is designated as the _content pane_. The figure of
each child is added to the content pane. The end result is that you have
three separate hierarchical data structures which are approximately
parallel to each other.

image:images/mvctree.gif[image]

Connections are the exception to this simple tree structure. Connections
represent a link or association between two objects. A Draw2d connection
figure is used as the view. Connections may be stored in any way in the
model, but the editparts are managed by the source and target editpart
at each end. A connection editpart's figure containment is also handled
specially. The connection figure is added to a special layer in the
diagram so that it paints above the primary layer containing
non-connection parts.

There are two types of editpart implementations provided with GEF.
Graphical editparts use figures as their view. Graphical editparts also
add the ability to support connections, which themselves are graphical
editparts. The other type is a tree editpart. Tree editparts use SWT
treeitems as their view.

The responsibilities of each editpart include:

* Create and maintain a view (whether figure or treeitem)
* Create and maintain children editparts
* Create and maintain connections editparts
* Support editing of the model

Note that maintaining the view and other editparts implies that the
editpart will be notified of changes in the model. Usually, the editpart
hooks a listener directly to the model object(s) with which it is
associated. When it receives notification, it updates its view or
structure depending on the change.

As the name implies, editparts must support editing the model. But first
we will focus on the initial steps of building an application, which is
to display the initial model.

=== [#GraphicalView]#Creating a Graphical View of a Model#

Once you have a model and some figures with which to view it, the next
step is to put the pieces together. This means creating the editparts
that are going to work with each model and figure combination. GEF's
implementations are abstract and must be extended for your application.
But first, we need to set up the foundation.

GEF includes the class `ScrollingGraphicalViewer`. This is a viewer
implementation which uses a Draw2d `FigureCanvas`. *Most applications
use this viewer* unless, for some reason, scrollbars are not needed. The
next step is to decide which _root_ editpart to use. Each editpart
viewer requires a special editpart called the root. This editpart does
not correspond to anything in the model. Its function is to setup the
viewer and provide a uniform context for all of the application's "real"
editparts. There are two implementations to consider using:

* `*ScalableRootEditPart*` - provides the standard set of layers and
supports zoom should the application decide to expose this to the user.
* `*ScalableFreeformRootEditPart*` - similar to above, but all of the
layers conform to the _freeform_ interface, which allows the diagram to
additionally extend into negative coordinates (to the left and up). This
is the most flexible and *commonly used* root editpart.

Now we have a viewer and its root editpart, so next we'll actually set
some contents into the viewer. _Contents_ refers to the base model
object that seeds the viewer with the graphical diagram being displayed.
The viewer's `*EditPartFactory*` is then responsible for taking the
contents and constructing the appropriate editpart, which is then set on
the root editpart. Its figure gets added to the root's. At that point
the contents editpart will construct its children editparts, reusing the
viewer's factory, which in turn then create their children and/or
connections, etc., until all of the editparts and their views have been
created.

image:images/factory.gif[image]

==== Implementing the Contents EditPart

So the first implementation you will need to write is the contents
editpart. You'll also need to implement a factory which recognizes the
contents model object and constructs this editpart. This part's figure
provides the backdrop for the rest of the diagram. Usually it doesn't
even need to paint, but you still need to choose the layout manager and
the figure type based on the root editpart. To control which figure gets
created, override `*createFigure()*`. When using a freeform root, the
contents figure must implement the freeform API. The `*FreeformLayer*`
figure will suffice. The layout manager is often the `*XYLayout*` or the
`*FreeformLayout*`, again depending on whether the root is freeform or
not.

During initialization, the contents editpart will construct its children
based on the list returned when calling `*getModelChildren()*` on itself.
Editparts should override this method to return the list of objects in
the model for which child editparts should be created. By default,
editparts go back to the viewer's factory to create each child.

==== Implementing the Children EditParts

The children of the diagram, sometimes called _nodes_, usually display
some information to the user. Their figures may be one of the default
provided figures, a custom figure, or a composition of multiple figures.
During the population of the viewer, each editpart will have its
`*refreshVisuals()*` method called. This method is responsible for
reflecting the model's properties in the view. Editparts must override
this method based on the model and figure they work with. In complex
cases this method can be factored out into several smaller helper
methods. Later, when we start listening to model changes, this method or
its helpers may be invoked again.

If a child of the diagram is also a parent with its own children, it
needs to override `*getModelChildren()*` in the same manner that the
diagram editpart did.

==== Adding Connection EditParts

Connections are special editparts that connect any two editparts in a
diagram. An editpart is called a _node_ if it can be the source or
target of a connection. The connections are created and managed in a
shared way by both of its _source_ and _target_ nodes. Each node in the
diagram must override `*getModelSourceConnections()*` and
`*getModelTargetConnections()*` to return the model objects representing
the connections. GEF then checks to see if the connection editpart has
already been created (by the other node at the other end), and if not it
asks the factory to create the connection editpart. The source node is
responsible for activating and adding the connection figure to the
diagram.

A connection editpart's figure must be a Draw2d `*Connection*`. The
connection editpart attempts to set its figure's anchors by casting the
source and target nodes to a `*NodeEditPart*`. The source and target must
return the appropriate anchors or default anchors with bogus fixed
locations will be used instead.

In many ways connections are just like other editparts. They typically
have properties in their model that must be visualized. They may even
themselves have children or be nodes to other connections.

==== Summary

So far we have focused on just displaying a model graphically. This
requires that you extend `*AbstractGraphicalEditPart*` and override
behavior based on each part's model. Here is a summary of the methods
discussed:

* `*createFigure()*` - this method creates the editpart's view, or figure.
This method does *not* reflect the model's state in the figure. That is
done in refreshVisuals()
* `*refreshVisuals()*` - this method reflects model attributes in the
view. Complex editparts may further decompose this method into several
helper methods.
* `*getModelChildren()*` - this method is called to determine if there are
model elements for which children editparts should be created.
* `*getModelSource/TargetConnections()*` - similar to children, but model
elements returned here indicate connections for which the editpart is
the source or target.

=== [#Editing]#Editing and EditPolicies#

Once you have some editparts displayed it's time to start editing.
Editing is usually the most complex task an editpart performs. Editing
includes not only making changes to the model, but also showing
graphical feedback during interactions with the view. To abstract away
the source of interaction, GEF uses a request. Tools or other UI
interpreters will create requests and then call the various API on
EditPart based on the interaction. A subset of the EditPart API is shown
below.

[width="100%",cols="1%,99%",]
|===
|image:images/editing1.gif[image] a|
Methods on `EditPart` which take a *Request*:

. `*EditPart getTargetEditPart(Request)*` +
  `*boolean understandsRequest(Request)*`
. `*void showSourceFeedback(Request)*` +
  `*void eraseSourceFeedback(Request)*` +
  `*void showTargetFeedback(Request)*` +
  `*void eraseTargetFeedback(Request)*`
. `*Command getCommand(Request)*`
. `*void performRequest(Request)*`

|===

[width="100%",cols="1%,99%",]
|===
a|*1*|The first step of editing is to decide which editparts are
involved. Usually, it is some combination of the viewer's current
selection and an editpart calculated using the current mouse location.
The selection can be trimmed by asking if each selected part understands
a request. The part under the mouse, called the _target_, is found with
the viewer's help and the `*getTargetEditPart(Request)*` method. Not all
interactions have targets.
|*2*|During interactions, especially mouse interactions and dragging,
editparts are asked to show feedback based on their role in the
interaction. An editpart is considered the _source_ if it is the part
being acted on. A _target_ editpart is the part underneath the mouse.
For example, when dragging a node around a diagram, the node is the
source, and the diagram is the target. The node is asked to show source
feedback, which might be a rectangle or some other modified
representation of the node. The diagram is asked to show target
feedback. When reattaching the end of a connection, a node might be
showing target feedback instead. Some interactions only operate on a
source.
|*3*|The command is what eventually changes the model. Editparts are
asked for a command for a given request. Commands also help determine if
the interaction is possible. If there is no command, or it is not
executable, the UI will indicate that the interaction is not allowed. If
an editpart contributes NULL as its command, it does not prevent the
interaction from occurring, unless of course no commands are provided by
any of the editparts. To indicate something is not allowed, the editpart
must return a command that is not executable.
|*4*|Finally, there is a generic API telling an editpart to just "do
something". This is generally something that does not immediately result
in a model change. For example, opening a dialog or activating the
"direct-edit" mode.
|===

==== EditPolicies


[width="100%",cols="95%,5%",]
|===
| Editparts don't handle editing directly.
Instead, they use EditPolicies. Each editpolicy is then able to focus on
a single editing task or group of related tasks. This also allows
editing behavior to be selectively reused across different editpart
implementations. Also, behavior can change dynamically, such as when the
layouts or routing methods change.

When any of the above editing methods are called (except
`*performRequest()*`), the editpart delegates to its policies to satisfy
the request. Depending on the method, the editpart may stop at the first
policy that handles a request, or it may allow each policy a chance to
contribute. Refer to each method's javadoc for more details.

During the editpart's creation, `*createEditPolicies()*` is called and the
editpart should install the appropriate policies. EditPolicies are
installed using _roles_, which are nothing more than identifiers that
serve as keys. GEF provides several identifiers for commonly used roles.
Roles become important when an editpart needs to have its policies
removed or swapped out. The rest of the time it is just a good habit.
GEF also provides several policies for use with these roles. Many of
these policies must be extended to fill in the missing pieces that work
with the application's model. EditPolicies are discussed in more detail
in the section on link:#Interactions[interactions].
| image:images/editing2.gif[image] 
|===

==== Commands

Commands are passed around throughout editing. They are used to
encapsulate and combine changes to the application's model.

An application has a single command stack. Commands must be executed
using the command stack rather than directly calling execute.

=== [#Lifecycle]#The EditPart Lifecycle#

With respect to lifecycle, editpart implementations typically only have
to worry about extending activation and deactivation, which is when the
editpart should add and remove its model listeners. Still, an
understanding of the entire lifecycle is important.

==== 1) Creation

The first thing that happens is creation. Most editparts will be created
by the viewer's factory, which is invoked by either the viewer or the
managing editpart which is typically the parent. Immediately after being
created, the following methods are called:

`*setModel()*` - If the constructor does not take the model as an
argument, it should be set immediately. Other events that follow may be
based on the part's model.

==== 2) Getting Added to the Diagram

`*setParent(...)*` - The very first step is to tell the part its parent.
This gives the part a path back to its viewer, which it might need for
things like accessing the editpart registry.

`*createFigure()*` - Although this is a protected method, the timing of
when it gets called is somewhat interesting. Both the parent and the
model are known at the time the figure needs to be created.

`*addNotify()*` - Signals the completion of the child being added to the
parent. At this point, the child will do the following:

. Register itself with the viewer using both its view and its model.
. Create any editpolicies that it needs.
. Refresh, meaning update first its own view, and then construct any
structural elements of its own such as children or connections.

`*activate()*` - Indicates that the editpart should become active for
editing, meaning that the model might change. The parent only activates
its child if it is also active. The root is only active if the viewer
has created its Control. An editpart should do the following on
activation:

. Start listening to the model. Subclasses should *extend* this method
to add any necessary listeners.
. Activate all of the editpolicies.
. Activate all children and outgoing connection editparts.

==== 3) Normal Use

At this point the editpart is in its normal editing state. It gets
selected, shows feedback, and returns commands, etc., until it is no
longer needed, meaning it is either removed from the diagram or the
viewer is being disposed.

==== 4) Becoming Garbage

`*deactivate()*` - The opposite of activate. Once again, subclasses should
*extend* this method to remove the listeners added during activation.


[width="100%",cols="1%,95%",]
|===
| image:images/important.gif[image] | The remaining steps *only* occur when
the editpart gets removed, meaning its model was removed from the
diagram. If the viewer is being disposed, then deactivation is the only
thing that is guaranteed to occur. For this reason, activate and
deactivate are the commonly extended methods while the remaining methods
can usually be ignored.
|===

`*removeNotify()*` - Signals that the editpart is about to incur removal.
The following must happen while the editpart still has access to its
surroundings:

. Make sure the editpart is no longer selected or has focus.
. Call removeNotify on children so that they can do the same.
. Un-register the editpart from the viewer's registries.
. Remove self as source or target of any connections. Connections don't
go away unless both source and target get set to null.

`*setParent(null)*` - The last step of removal. The parent and viewer are
no longer reachable at this point.

[width="100%",cols="1%,95%",]
|===
| image:images/important.gif[image] | Editparts do not come back from the
grave. When a change in the model is undone, a *new* editpart is
created. For this reason, commands should not reference editparts, and
editparts should not contain any important state that must be restored
on undo.
|===

=== [#ToolPalette]#Tools and the Palette#

A tool handles most events from a viewer. The `EditDomain` keeps track
of the currently active tool. Applications may use the palette
(PaletteViewer) to display multiple tools, allowing the user to change
between modes such as selection, creation, etc.

==== How Tools Work

Tools are implemented like state machines. SWT events provide the input
to the state machine. Based on the event and current state, a tool will
perform certain actions. These actions could include:

* Asking editparts to show or hide feedback.
* Obtaining commands from editparts.
* Executing a command on the command stack.
* Updating the mouse cursor.

A tool is activated by setting it on the EditDomain. There is only one
active tool for all viewers in the domain. If a palette is being used,
selecting a tool in the palette will activate that tool.

==== [#Tools/Selection]#The Selection Tool#

The Selection Tool is the primary tool used in GEF and is often the
default for an application. The selection tool is unique in its ability
to delegate. It obtains a helper called a `DragTracker` from an editpart
or handle below the mouse when a drag occurs. A drag is defined as a
mouse button being pressed, its being released, and any events that
occur in between. Events are forwarded to the delegate so that the drag
can be handled differently based on where and how the drag originated.
For example, clicking on a handle may result in resizing a shape, or
moving the end of a connection. Clicking on an editpart typically drags
that part to a new location or parent.

image:images/selectsequence.gif[image]

Ironically, the Selection Tool doesn't select editparts. All mouse
clicks are handled as drags. When the Selection Tool receives a mouse
down event over a selectable editpart, it asks for a drag tracker. The
editpart returns a tracker derived from SelectEditPartTracker. The
tracker also receives the mouse down event, as well as any other events,
until the mouse button is released. When the tracker interprets a
selection gesture, it modifies the viewer's selection. Trackers even
handle events like double-click.

For more on the selection tool and trackers, see the section on
link:#Interactions/Selection[Selection Interaction].

==== Palette

GEF's `*PaletteViewer*` provides an SWT Control allowing the user to
select which Tool is active. It can also be a drag source for dragging
objects from the palette directly into the diagram. Use of the palette
is optional, but common.

The palette can be placed anywhere, including inside the editor. GEF
provides a Workbench View for hosting the Palette. Also, a custom
Composite, the `*FlyoutPaletteComposite*`, will manage the placement of
the PaletteViewer beside a primary Control. This composite is used as
the editor's primary control in the Logic Example, shown below:

image:images/logiceditor.gif[image]

The PaletteViewer displays a Palette model, which starts with the
`*PaletteRoot*`. The root organizes the contents using either drawers,
which open and close, or groups, which do not. Each grouping element
then contains Palette Entries. An Entry defines either a tool or
template for the User. Templates are described below in
link:#Interactions/Creation[Creation].

The Palette provides several display modes, such as icon-only. You can
also provide a customizer to allow the user to modify or create palette
content.

=== [#Interactions]#Types of Interactions in GEF#

This section discusses the various types of interactions that are
included in the framework, and which parts of the framework are involved
in supporting the interaction. An interaction can be anything that
affects the model or the UI state. Many interactions are graphical but
some are not. An interaction may include:

* Invoking some Action (usually displayed on the toolbar, menubar, or
popup).
* Clicking on something.
* Clicking and dragging something.
* Hovering over something (pausing the mouse for a certain time).
* Dropping something dragged from another source (native Drag-N-Drop).
* Pressing certain keys.

This section discusses the participants involved in each interaction and
what they do. This can include:

* Tools which process input.
* Actions which are invoked.
* The IDs and instances of Requests that are sent to editparts by tools
or actions. ID's are defined on the `RequestConstants` class.
* The EditPolicy roles designated to handle specific types of requests.
These are just constants defined on the EditPolicy interface.
* Any EditPolicy implementations provided in GEF for use with the
interaction.

|===

No interaction is more basic or universal than selecting items in a
viewer. Most of the interactions discussed here operate on what is
currently selected. Yet, selection is a complex topic and there are
several steps involved. The Selection Tool was
link:#Tools/Selection[briefly discussed] in the above section on tools.

Let's first define selection. Selection is a List of EditParts
maintained by an EditPartViewer. Changes to the selection are made by
invoking methods on the viewer, and not by modifying the list directly.
The selection is never empty. If the selection is cleared, the viewer's
_contents_ editpart becomes the selection. The last editpart in the list
is considered the _primary_ selection.

Closely related to selection is _focus_. Focus is a single editpart
maintained by the EditPartViewer. Focus is used when manipulating
selection via keyboard. By moving focus, the user can navigate from one
editpart to another without changing the current selection. The user can
add/remove the focused editpart from the selection. If focus is not
explicitly set, it is the same as the primary selected part.

[width="100%",cols="1%,99%",]
|===
|image:images/selectionhandles.gif[image] +
_Selection Handles_ a|
The editpart is responsible for showing its selected and focused state
to the user. The viewer tells editparts when they are selected, focused,
or have primary selection. Typically, selection is shown by one or more
EditPolicies adding selection handles. The handles shown here on the LED
and circuit parts were added by `*ResizableEditPolicy*`. The black handles
indicate primary selection.

Because selection handles are related to how a part can be dragged or
sized, which in turn is related to the containing figure's layout
manager, it is usually the parent part's editpolicy that installs a
policy on the children for displaying the appropriate handles. For
example, an XYLayoutEditPolicy would install a ResizableEditPolicy on
each child of its host editpart.

Connections may (`*WireEditPart*` in the Logic Example) also change its
figure's line width to help indicate selection. Handles for connections
are contributed by both `*EndpointEditPolicy*` and `*BendpointEditPolicy*`.

|===

*Selection Targeting and Feedback*

For selection to occur, the Selection Tool must first target an editpart
using a `*SelectionRequest*`. In rare cases, an editpart is not selectable
and targeting "falls through", hitting the editpart below. During this
continuous mouse targeting, the Selection Tool invokes showFeedback() on
the current target editpart by passing it a `*SelectionRequest*` of type
REQ_SELECTION. It is recommended that most applications ignore this
request since showing and hiding feedback as the mouse moves across a
diagram can be very distracting to the user. For this reason, there is
an additional feedback request sent with the type REQ_SELECTION_HOVER
whenever the user pauses the mouse over an editpart. Often an editpart
will display a popup shell similar to a tooltip displaying additional
information about the part. The SELECTION_FEEDBACK_ROLE identifier can
be used when installing policies which show such feedback.

A benefit to using these feedback requests is that the Selection Tool is
smart about asking parts to erase feedback. For example, if the user
starts dragging, you would not want a popup message to stay around.
Also, selection feedback will not occur when other tools are active.

*Selection via a DragTracker*

Once the user actually presses down on the mouse, the selection target
will be asked for a `*DragTracker*`. To allow selection, return a
`*SelectEditPartTracker*` or its subclass `*DragEditPartsTracker*`,
depending on whether dragging is permitted. These trackers will modify
selection at the appropriate time, taking into consideration the SHIFT
and CTRL modifier keys.

The contents editpart should *never* be selected by a tracker. The
reason being that it should never be part of a multiple selection.
Therefore, it should return either a `*DeselectAllTracker*`, or the
`*MarqueeDragTracker*`. Remember, the selection is never empty so the
contents part will be the selection when all other parts are not
selected.

*Other Selection Requests*

Editparts may be asked to perform two additional Requests that are
related to selection. These requests are related to selection in that
they are interactions associated with clicking the primary mouse button.
The first is a double-click, which is called an _open_ (REQ_OPEN). This
interaction can be used for editparts that can be opened, expanded, or
may display a dialog. The other interaction is called a _direct edit_
(REQ_DIRECT_EDIT). An example of direct editing is when the user wishes
to modify the text of a label. The user must first select the part, and
then click on it again after it is selected. After a brief delay (used
to rule out a double-click), the request is sent.

*Selection Actions*

GEF provides a `*SelectAllAction*`. Given a viewer, this action selects
all of the contents part's children when invoked.

*Selection using the Keyboard*

Keyboard selection is supported in graphical viewers by installing a
`*GraphicalViewerKeyHandler*`. The key handler only receives key events
sent to it by the current tool. The Selection Tool forwards key forwards
the events necessary for selection.

[width="100%",cols="1%,99%",]
|===
| image:images/important.gif[image] | Drag trackers are not needed inside
GEF's TreeViewer. The native tree handles selection already, and
dragging of treeitems is processed internally using native DND.

==== Basic Model Operations (Delete)

[.custom,width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]
|===
|Tools |Requests |Edit Policies and Roles |Actions
| |REQ_DELETE |COMPONENT_ROLE +
CONNECTION_ROLE +
RootComponentEditPolicy |DeleteAction
|===

image:images/interactdelete.gif[image]

The only universal interaction that all GEF applications should support
is delete. The workbench places a global delete action on the edit menu.
All applications should register a handler such as the included
DeleteAction.

The DeleteAction sends a `*GroupRequest*` of type REQ_DELETE to the
viewer's current selection. All editparts should have an editpolicy
which either supports or prevents delete from occurring.

Every editpart is either a component or a connection. A component is a
basic editpart that is the child of a parent. A connection is slightly
different because it is owned by its source and target.

The COMPONENT_ROLE key is used when installing an editpolicy on a
component editpart. Applications can extend the provided
`*ComponentEditPolicy*` to fill in the commands for deletion. The
`*RootComponentEditPolicy*` should be used on the contents editpart. This
policy prevents the diagram itself from being deleted. Here, "root"
refers to the model root and is not related to the viewer's root
editpart.

The CONNECTION_ROLE key is used when installing a policy on a connection
editpart. Applications can extend the provided `*ConnectionEditPolicy*` to
fill in the command for deletion.

These editpolicies should handle the tasks most closely associated with
the model. In the logic example, this role is responsible for the LED's
increment and decrement behavior, which adds or subtracts one from the
LED's value.

[width="100%",cols="1%,99%",]
|===
| image:images/important.gif[image] | Implementing the command that performs
delete can be difficult, especially when connections are involved. The
command must consider whether the object being deleted has connections,
or if children of the object being deleted have connections, and delete
the connections as well. But, you don't want to delete the same
connection twice in cases where both source and target nodes are being
deleted as part of multiple selection. The logic example's delete
command addresses all of these concerns.

A `*CreateRequest*` is used to ask an editpart to create a new child. The
request is identified by the ID REQ_CREATE. Creation can occur through
three different methods: clicking, dragging, or pasting. The request
provides the location, object, and object type being created. The object
and its type are provided by a `*CreationFactory*`. The request hides the
factory and provides access to the created object directly, caching it
in case multiple editpolicies all need access to the created object. In
some cases, the request will contain a size attribute.

*Producing CreateRequests*

The creation tool provides a "loaded cursor" mode which will attempt to
create an object at the mouse location when clicking. If the mouse is
pressed and dragged, the tool will track the size of the rectangle
defined by the user. The creation tool can be placed on the palette
using a `*CreationToolEntry*`. When the mouse is released, the tool will
either repeat the process or switch back to the default tool.

Creation can also be performed using native Drag-and-Drop. The drag
source can be anything, but it is typically the PaletteViewer. A palette
entry taking a _template_ is added to the palette. The
`*TemplateTransfer*` is used to transfer the template, which is just an
Object, from the drag source to the drop target. A
TemplateTransferDragSourceListener must be added to the PaletteViewer.
Similarly, the viewer must have a TemplateTransferDropTargetListener.
Since a template is model-specific, the application must extend the drop
target listener to convert the template into a CreationFactory for the
request.

A special palette entry called the `*CombinedTemplateCreationEntry*`
supports both the creation tool and drag-and-drop style of creation.

*Consuming CreateRequests*

The target editpart is responsible for showing feedback and returning
the command for creation. GEF provides two types of policies for
handling creation. One type of policy is specific for the view in which
creation occurs, either graphical or tree-based. This edit policy
corresponds to either the LAYOUT_ROLE or the TREE_CONTAINER_ROLE.

The other type of edit policy is specific to only the model, should
applications wish to separate out the portion that is shared between
graphical and non-graphical creation. In most cases, any kind of shared
logic is in the command implementations, making this type of policy
unnecessary.

A `*LayoutEditPolicy*` handles the process of creation based on the
container's layout manager. For example, if the XYLayout is being used,
then the resulting Command will need to associate an (x, y, w ,h)
constraint with the created child. Layouts that don't use constraints
would require that the index of the drop location be determined. GEF
provides abstract policies for the basic layout types.

The `*TreeContainerEditPolicy*` is used for supporting creation in a
tree-based viewer. The policy is responsible for determining the index
of creation and showing feedback.

The `*PasteTemplateAction*` can be used to create objects without the
mouse. This is important for accessibility. The `*CopyTemplateAction*` is
added to the Palette. When the user invokes this action, an internal
mechanism copies the transfer so that it can be pasted in a viewer. When
paste occurs, the PasteTemplateAction retrieves the template object,
constructs a CreateRequest, and sends it to the selected editpart. Mouse
location is not available in this interaction. Paste is only enabled
when the selection is exactly one editpart.

| image:images/important.gif[image] | When a creation command is redone, it
must restore the original child that was created the first time it was
executed. If it creates a new object, then subsequent commands will fail
on redo when they try to modify the originally created child.

The DragEditPartsTracker extends basic selection behavior to allow the
selected parts to be dragged within their graphical viewer. Dragging the
selected parts can result in three potential interactions: move,
reparent, and clone. All three use the `*ChangeBoundsRequest*`, which
extends GroupRequest to include a size delta, move delta, and mouse
location.

While dragging the selection, if the tracker targets the part's original
parent, the request is typed as `*REQ_MOVE*`. If the target changes, the
interaction becomes a reparent. For a reparent, a request of type
`*REQ_ORPHAN*` is sent to the old parent, while the new target is sent a
request of type `*REQ_ADD*`. When the CTRL key is pressed (ALT on the
Mac), the operation is always a `*REQ_CLONE*`, which is only sent to the
target part.

All of these requests are related in that they require the target to
process a rectangle and a mouse location. The LayoutEditPolicy is
responsible for handling each of these request types. For layouts which
use constraints, each part's original bounds is taken and modified by
the size and move deltas to determine a new bounds, for which a
corresponding constraint is found. For index-based layouts, the mouse
location is used to establish the new index.

A `*ContainerEditPolicy*` can optionally be used to contribute additional
commands (not related to the layout) during ADD, ORPHAN, and CLONE
requests.

*Resizing*

Resizing falls under the same category as changing bounds. Note that
when resizing either the top or left sides, the location of the part is
also changed. Resizing only makes sense for layouts with constraints,
such as XYLayout. The `*ResizableEditPolicy*` adds up to eight resize
handles to its host. When the Selection Tool is clicked on one of these
resize handles, a `*ResizeTracker*` performs a resize on the selected
parts understanding "resize". SHIFT and CTRL key modifiers can be used
to constrain the resize operation.

The types of handles available on an editpart depend on the layout
manager in which its figure is placed. For example, parts inside a table
might have handles for adjusting insets, padding, column span, or other
attributes. Some layouts don't need any handles, but four corner handles
should be added just to indicate selection. Dragging these handles would
be the same as dragging the part itself.

Because of the relationship between handles and layouts, it is
recommended that the `*PRIMARY_DRAG_ROLE*` editpolicy be installed by the
parent's `LayoutEditPolicy`, which defines abstract methods for this
purpose. If a container changes layout managers during editing,
typically the layout policy gets swapped with one for the new layout
manager. The new policy then replaces the stale `*PRIMARY_DRAG_ROLE*`
policies on each child.

The `*MatchSizeAction*` matches the size of the selected parts to that of
the primary selected part's size. This action is implemented in a way
similar to manually resizing the individual parts, and it uses the same
request and type.

The `*AlignmentAction*` uses an `*AlignmentRequest*`, which extends
ChangeBoundsRequest. When using a ChangeBoundsRequest, the part's
current placement in the Control (in absolute coordinates) is passed to
the request, which then returns a modified version. Using this pattern,
alignment is able to adjust each part's rectangle by different amounts.
In most cases, alignment can be treated no differently than a move. This
action aligns all selected parts with one of the edges of the primary
selected part.

The `*ConnectionCreationTool*` is used to create a new connection between
nodes. This interaction requires the user to activate the tool
(typically using the palette), and then click on two editparts
supporting connections. The creation can be aborted by pressing the ESC
key. The `*ConnectionDragCreationTool*` is similar, but the interaction is
a single mouse drag. This tool can be returned as the drag tracker from
a handle or even an editpart in some cases.

The process is separated into two parts. The first part is defining the
_source_ of the connection. The source is a node, but it may also
include a specific "port" on that node. The tool uses a
`*CreateConnectionRequest*` identified by REQ_CONNECTION_START to
determine the target editpart and ask it for a command. However, this is
only the first half of creating the connection, so the command is not
complete yet. The tool will not attempt to execute this command or even
ask if it is executable. This command is only used to pass information
to the target editpart.

The second part is to define the target node for the connection. The
tool uses the same request but retypes it as REQ_CONNECTION_END. The
command returned by the source node is now stored on the request and
passed during the second part of the interaction. The target is asked
for the final command that performs the entire creation of the
connection. Any command can be returned at this point, including the
command provided on the request, updated with the target node
information. At this point, enablement will be determined by asking the
command if it can be executed. Creation ends by executing the command.

During the first and second steps, the editpart being targeted as the
source or target node is asked to show *target* feedback. The editpart
might visually highlight various attachment points or simply indicate
that it is the target.

The source node editpart is also asked to show *source* feedback during
creation. The provided `*GraphicalNodeEditPolicy*` can be used to display
creation feedback. This policy will create a connection feedback figure,
and set its anchors using the `*NodeEditPart*` interface. This mix-in
interface for `*GraphicalEditPart*` is used both during creation feedback,
and when the connection's editpart is created, to provide anchor points.

The "source" and "target" nodes should not be confused with "source" and
"target" feedback. For feedback, "source" simply means show the feedback
for the connection, while "target" means highlight the mouse target.

image:images/interactreconnect.gif[image]

By dragging the endpoints of an existing connection, its source or
target can be changed. This includes changing "ports" on the same node
editpart. This interaction is called reconnecting.

A connection adds handles at its endpoints by installing a
`*ConnectionEndpointEditPolicy*` with the ENDPOINT_ROLE. Each of these
handles returns a tracker for reconnecting the corresponding end of the
connection. This policy is also responsible for showing the connections
feedback during the interaction. This policy does not return commands
and therefore is not abstract. The reconnect command comes from the new
target node.

As the source or target endpoint is dragged, the tracker sends source
feedback requests to the connection, and target feedback requests to the
current target if there is one. The tracker uses a `*ReconnectRequest*`
typed as either a source or target reconnect.

The target node's GraphicalNodeEditPolicy is responsible for showing
target feedback and returning the actual command to perform the
reconnect. As with creation, the target editpart should implement the
`*NodeEditPart*` interface, which allows the ConnectionEndpointEditPolicy
to snap the feedback to the nodes anchor(s).

| Certain connection routers accept
routing constraints (typically a list of `*BendPoints*`). Install a
`*BendpointEditPolicy*` using the `*CONNECTION_BENDPOINTS_ROLE*` for editing
the connections routing constraints. This editpolicy requires a router
that takes a List of BendPoints. During selection, the policy will add
normal handles to existing bendpoints on the connection. It adds smaller
handles where the user can create new bendpoints. +
Each handle provides a `*ConnectionBendpointTracker*`. This tool sends a
`*BendpointRequest*` back to the connection editpart for showing feedback
and obtaining the command to perform the bend. For existing bendpoints,
the request is typed as `*REQ_MOVE_BENDPOINT*`, otherwise it is
`*REQ_CREATE_BENDPOINT*`. It is up to the editpolicy to determine when
moving a bendpoint back to its natural placement should result in its
removal.

connection in the Logic Example with a single Bendpoint. The
`*ShortestPathConnectionRouter*` has inserted additional bends in the
connection to avoid figures. The handles for creating and moving
bendpoints are labeled with the index that the BendpointRequest will
contain. The index is the same as the current (or eventual) index of the
bendpoint in the routing constraint's List.
