<h1>Programmer's Guide</h1>
<p>
The Graphical Editing Framework (GEF) provides a foundation for building rich, 
interactive user interfaces which are not easily built using native widgets 
found in the base Eclipse platform.</p>
<p>This guide provides an architectural overview of the Graphical Editing 
Framework.&nbsp; The 
reader should have working knowledge of the Eclipse platform.</p>
<p>The GEF component is separated into two plug-ins:</p>
<ul dir="ltr">
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p>Draw2d (<code>org.eclipse.draw2d</code>) - the lightweight toolkit for 
	painting and layout on an SWT Canvas</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p>GEF (<code>org.eclipse.gef</code>) - an interactive MVC framework built 
	on top of Draw2d</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Notice that the term GEF can refer to the entire component (2 
plug-ins), or specifically to the plug-in org.eclipse.gef.</p>
