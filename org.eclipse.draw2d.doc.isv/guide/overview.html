<h2>Draw2d</h2>
<p>
<img src="images/system.gif" align="right"/>Draw2d is a lightweight toolkit of graphical components called <b><i>figures</i></b>. 
Lightweight means that a figure is simply a java object, with no corresponding 
resource in the operating system. Figures can be composed via a parent-child 
relationship. Every figure has a rectangular <b><i>bounds</i></b> inside which it, 
and its children, paint. Usually, a layout manager determines where to place 
children based on their index and/or constraint.</p>
<p>
A <code>LightweightSystem</code> associates a figure composition with an SWT Canvas. 
The lightweight system hooks listeners for most SWT events, and forwards 
most of them to an <code>EventDispatcher</code>, which translates them into events on 
the appropriate figure.</p>
<p>
Paint events, however, are forwarded to the <code>UpdateManager</code>, 
which coordinates painting and layout. Figures can be updated in ways which 
affect their appearance or size, and the update manager ensures that only one 
layout pass occurs, followed by a repaint of only the region which was updated.</p>
<p>
Any type of diagram, document, or drawing can be easily constructed and 
efficiently updated by combining the provided figure and layout implementations 
along with the use of custom figures or layouts when needed.</p>
