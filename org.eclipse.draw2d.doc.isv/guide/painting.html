<h2>Painting of Figures</h2>
<p>
Figures are painted using a <code>Graphics</code>. The Graphics abstraction 
allows Draw2d to wrapper an SWT GC for extended functionality as well as 
performance optimizations. For example, Graphics supports pushing and popping of 
the current state.&nbsp;A figure paints using the 
following process:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b><code>Figure#paint()</code></b> - This method is declared on the 
	interface, and kicks off the painting process. First, properties are set on the Graphics that would be inherited by children, including 
	Font, background, and foreground Color. Then the Graphics state is pushed so 
	that just these inherited settings can be restored when painting children. 
	Next, the following methods are called:<ul>
		<li><code><b>Figure#paintFigure()</b></code> - The figure paints itself. Figures are not required to paint at all. A 
	simple form of painting would be to fill in the bounding box with the 
	figure's background color.</li>
		<li><code><b>Figure#paintClientArea()</b></code> - The client area is 
		where children appear. This method should apply any changes to the 
		Graphics which affect only children, such as coordinate system 
		modifications like translating the graphics to the client area. This 
		method also clips the graphics two the region where children are allowed 
		to appear.<ul>
			<li><b><code>Figure#paintChildren()</code></b> - Now that the client 
			area is setup, children are painted. After each child paints, the 
			graphics state is restored to the incoming state so that children do 
			not overwrite the inherited graphics settings from the parent</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><b><code>Figure#paintBorder()</code></b> - Finally, the figure 
		paints decorations which should appear on top of the children. If a 
		Border has been set on the figure, it paints now.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Z-Order</h3>
<p>The result of this process is that a figure composition (which structurally 
is a tree) paints in a pre-order, depth-first manner. The exception being the 
borders which are painted post-order. Using push and pop, changes made to the 
Graphics by one branch of figures have no affect on other branches. The order in 
which figures paint is often referred to as z-order. This term comes from the 
fact that the paint order creates the illusion of depth, and the z-axis would be 
perpendicular to the display's x and y axes. Z-order or paint order is also 
manifested in the way hit testing is done.</p>

<h3>Clipping</h3>
<p>When a figure paints its children, it first clips the Graphics to 
its client area. As each child is painted, the graphics is also clipped to the 
child's bounds. This prevents the child from painting outside of its bounds or 
the client area of the parent. Clipping is cumulative based on the entire parent 
chain. Below, Figure 3 is parented by Figure 2, which is parented by Figure 1.</p>
