<h1>Hit Testing</h1>
<p>There are several situations which require finding a figure for a mouse 
location. For example, determining which tooltip to display when the mouse 
pauses on top of a figure canvas. Another example is interactive graphical 
applications, which must interpret dragging one figure on top of another.</p>
<p>There are four methods available on IFigure which perform hit testing, three 
of which are actually just convenience methods which call the fourth.</p>
<ul>
	<li>findFigureAt(int x, int y) - finds the top-most figure for the given x 
	and y coordinate</li>
	<li>findFigureAt(Point p) - similar to above, except takes a Point instead 
	of an int</li>
	<li>findFigureAtExcluding(int x, int y, Collection exclude) - finds the 
	top-most figure for the given coordinates that is not in the exclusion set 
	or contained by a figure in the exclusion set. This is used for ignoring a 
	figure being dragged, or for ignoring transparent layers or figures which 
	are not involved in an interaction.</li>
	<li>
	<p>findFigureAt(int x, int y, TreeSearch search) - The above 
	methods call this method. TreeSearch is a condition that is used to quickly 
	prune branches which should not be searched, and also to accept the final 
	candidate figure.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Hit testing must be done exactly the same way as painting. Clipping and 
coordinate changes must be duplicated in both. As an optimizations, branches of 
the figure composition tree are pruned by calling IFigure#containsPoint(). If a 
figure does not contain the location, it returns NULL and does not search its 
children. By default, all figures are considered to be the rectangular region 
defined by their bounds, regardless of how or if they paint. This can be 
overridden as it is in Polyline, Ellipse, and other figures.</p>
