<h3>Model</h3>
<p>The <i>model</i> portion is somewhat self-explanatory.&nbsp; The model should 
know nothing about the view or controller.&nbsp; It does however usually know 
about listeners to which it fires notifications (listener-notifier pattern).&nbsp; 
The model should be changed using {@link com.ibm.etools.common.command.Command 
Commands}, and the view should be updated in response to notification.</p>
<h3>View</h3>
<p>The <i>view</i> can be several things.&nbsp; It includes the <i>visual part</i> 
representing a model object(s).&nbsp; The most flexible visual parts are {@link 
com.ibm.etools.draw2d.Figure Figures} from draw2d.&nbsp; GEF also provides 
support for SWT TreeItems, but support for other visuals can easily be added.&nbsp; While &quot;visual part&quot; refers to an object directly representing a 
model object, the more encompassing &quot;view&quot; includes feedback, handles, tooltips, 
and all things visible to the user.&nbsp; All of these make up the view, and it 
is the controller's job to construct and manage them.</p>
<h3>Controller</h3>
<p>The <i>controller</i> is the most interesting part and is the primary focus 
of GEF.&nbsp; The controller is responsible for:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Building the <b>visual part</b> and all parts of the view</li>
  <li>Modifying the model through Commands in response to user input</li>
  <li>Observing the model and updating the view accordingly</li>
</ol>
<p>User input can be a wide variety of things.&nbsp; A part may support 
multiple, unrelated types of editing behavior.&nbsp; To support this, GEF 
provides a controller implementation whose entire behavior is provided by 
plugging in one or more helper objects.&nbsp; This allows for higher code reuse 
and easier code maintenance.</p>
<p>A controller in GEF is an {@link com.ibm.etools.gef.EditPart EditPart}.</p>
